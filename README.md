# Mob Loot Chest

A Minecraft Spigot plugin that makes sure mobs drop a loot chest upon death,
containing their usual drops.

When a mob drops loot a chest is spawned at its death location, containing
the items that would have been dropped by the mob. The chest stays until items
are looted or after a timeout of **30** seconds.

**Note:** Intended for Adventure mode only, as this can lead to item duplication
when block breaking is allowed.
